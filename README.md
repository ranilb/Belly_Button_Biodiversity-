# Belly Button Biodiversity
In this work, we use "Plotly", a JavaScript data visualization library and HTML to create three different types of graphs and show in a webpage.
The data set is obtained from a research group to see if they can synthesize beef from bacteria collected from belly buttons.

There are 153 volunteers in this data set and they all have different identification numbers. So,a dropdown menu is created in the webpage so that an identification number can be selected to visualize the information about each volunteer. For a selected volunteer, it can be observed that a bar chart of
"top 10 bacteria cultures found", a bubble chart of "bacteria cultures per sample" and a gauge of "belly button washing frequency srubs per week".
